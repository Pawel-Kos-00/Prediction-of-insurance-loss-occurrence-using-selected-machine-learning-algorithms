## About
The goal is to compare three selected machine learning methods — logistic regression, decision trees, and the naïve Bayes classifier — in the context of predicting the occurrence of an insurance claim. For each method, two models were built: the second model was intended to be the result of optimizing the first. Each model includes a table presenting its prediction performance.
